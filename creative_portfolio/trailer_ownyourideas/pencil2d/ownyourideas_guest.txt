The world is wonderful, some time you have an idea. You may hire someone to realize the idea. By this way, maybe, you do not own the idea yet you owe it. "Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere." (Albert Einstein). Because your start is just an imagination, what you need to do is "moving" or questing from A to B. On your quest, you make selection to accept or reject a lot of potential ways. If you hire some one for such activities, you does not learn or experience the potential ways which may help you aware the value of your solution. Doing this by yourself is a way of self-actualization, the highest level of  Maslow's hierarchy of needs. "There is no substitute for hard work.", "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration." (Thomas Edison). I am here to learn from you and to share with you about the methods and best practices for this quest.
